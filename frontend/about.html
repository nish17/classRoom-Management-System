      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p>
        As the name suggest Timetable Management System is used for managing the
        time table as well as finding free slots and empty classes as and when
        required. It can be used by both the faculties and students for finding
        free slots and alloting free classes by the admin department for various
        events and lectures. Currently, the existing system requires lot of
        manual hard work which is less efficient and therefore the need for more
        user friendly system which has higher efficiency. The number of branches
        and students have been constantly increasing and hence the allotment has
        to be alot more efficient and hence there is a strong need for a central
        software system for better management and faster allocation. This also
        helps in:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Human Error</li>
        <li>Human Labor</li>
        <li>Better Security</li>
        <li>Easy to handle</li>
        <li>Easy Maintenance and Updation</li>
        <li>Easy backup</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Problem Definition</h3>
      <p>
        We have a total of 5 blocks consisting of numerous Lecture Halls,
        Lecture Theatres, Libraries and Auditoriums which are used for various
        events and purposes including regular lectures. After the official time
        table is made, there is no central system which maintains the updated
        time table when a particular class in cancelled or is shifted. At time
        of allocation for activities by student clubs or Training and Placement
        Cell, there is no way of confirming whether a class is free or not and
        hence there is a possibility that it is allocated for two different
        purposes at the same time.
